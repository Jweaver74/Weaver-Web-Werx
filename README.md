## Repo Description
Advanced CSS:Portfolio
I created my portfolio to show my work through out the boot camp and to display to future employers. I will be able to add projects as they are completed, displaying my core skills and knowledge.


## What I learned
What I have learned up to this point in my bootcamp, is the proper skills needed to plan, code, and deploy a website containing HTML and CSS. Proper Github commands along with deploying my work within Github pages.



## Challenges 
There were a few challenges I ran into making this portfolio for myself.I struggled with the sematics of the HTML and the elements.  within CSS trying to figuring out the proper classes and elements to get the correct look with the page that i wanted.

 ## Solution
 With the help of my tutor and alot of google I was able to start my project over and head in the right direction to start the portfolio. With his help I was able to understand the elements better and get a cleaner look to my page. 

## Credits
SMU tudor-Suresh S Kumar, helped set me in the right direction for a better look.
