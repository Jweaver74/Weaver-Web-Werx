## Why I made this site
I created my portfolio website to show my work through out the boot camp and to display to future employers. 


## What I learned
What I have learned up to this point in my bootcamp, is the proper skills needed to plan, code, and deploy a website containing HTML and CSS. Proper Github commands along with deploying my work within Github pages.



## Challenges 
There were a few challenges I ran into making this portfolio for myself.
 I struggled with the sematics of the HTML and the elements.  Also in CSS figuring out the proper classes and elements to get the correct look within the page that i needed.

 ## Solution
 With the help of my tutor and alot of google I was able to start my project over and head in the right direction to start the portfolio. With his help I was able to understand the elements better and get a cleaner look to my page.
